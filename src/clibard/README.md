CLI bard â€” See all your last notifications in the terminal
==========================================================

The CLI bard is a very simple command line application that displays the last
D-Bus notifications in a single line of the terminal.

It is not an interactive application, it just displays a single line, and
overwrites it when a new notification comes.
At any time, as much as possible of the last notifications are displayed.
The display refreshes when a notification is added at the end of the line.

CLI bard is written in Python and is available under the AGPLv3 license.

To run it, just run the `clibard.py` script in a wide-enough terminal.
